Revealing the cryptocurrency trading
This project analyzes historical cryptocurrency trade data using machine learning 
approaches, such as regression models, to get insights into market dynamics and price 
movement patterns. The dataset, which was last updated on December 01, 2018, was derived 
from Kaggle's crypto-markets.csv and includes detailed transaction records of 2,071 currencies. 
It totals 942,297 observations over 13 variables, which include Market Cap, Volume, Symbol, 
Open, High, Low, Close, and Timestamp. The study reveals patterns, correlations, and outside 
variables impacting cryptocurrency pricing by utilizing sophisticated approaches such as 
regression models on this heterogeneous dataset. These results hold significance for traders, 
investors, and policymakers alike, providing invaluable perspectives for risk mitigation and 
informed decision-making among the unstable cryptocurrency landscape.
